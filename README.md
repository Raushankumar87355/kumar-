Objective:
To explore how various light spectrums (red, blue, green, and full spectrum) influence the growth and development of plants.

Materials:
Four identical plant species (e.g., radish or bean plants)

Four LED light sources with different spectrums (red, blue, green, full spectrum)

Plant pots and soil

Measuring tools (ruler, scale)

Watering can

pH meter

Data recording sheet

Procedure:
Setup:

Plant seeds of the same species in identical pots with the same soil.

Place each pot under a different light source: red, blue, green, and full spectrum.

Ensure that each plant receives the same amount of light exposure daily (e.g., 12 hours).

Growth Monitoring:

Water plants equally and regularly.

Measure and record plant height, number of leaves, and overall health weekly.

Monitor and record soil pH levels.

Data Analysis:

Compare the growth rates, leaf development, and overall health of plants under different light conditions.

Analyze which light spectrum promotes the best growth for the plant species.

Conclusion:

Draw conclusions about the effects of different light spectrums on plant growth.

Discuss any potential applications in agriculture or indoor gardening.

Report:

Write a detailed report with your findings, including charts or graphs to visualize the data.
